|[Experience Grounds Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05908)|EMNLP 2020|1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as one of the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated distributions. 2. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of complicated data, including handwritten digits, faces, house numbers, CIFAR images, physical models of scenes, segmentation, and predicting the future from static images. 3. Introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior.|
