|[Experience Grounds Language](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.703/)|EMNLP 2020|1. Posit that the present success of representation learning approaches trained on large, text-only corpora requires the parallel tradition of research on the broader physical and social context of language to address the deeper questions of communication.|
|[DynaBERT - Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04037)|NeurIPS 2020|1. Propose a novel dynamic BERT model (DynaBERT), which can flexibly adjust the size and latency by selecting adaptive width and depth. 2. Show that the proposed dynamic BERT (or RoBERTa) at its largest size has comparable performance as BERT-base (or RoBERTa-base), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods|
|[Distilling Knowledge Learned in BERT for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03829)|ACL 2020|1. Present a novel approach, Conditional Masked Language Modeling (C-MLM), to enable the finetuning of BERT on target generation tasks. 2. By leveraging BERT's idiosyncratic bidirectional nature, distilling knowledge learned in BERT can encourage auto-regressive Seq2Seq models to plan ahead, imposing global sequence-level supervision for coherent text generation. 3. Show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms strong Transformer baselines on multiple language generation tasks such as machine translation and text summarization.|
|[DeText - A Deep Text Ranking Framework with BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02460)|Arxiv 2020|1. Investigate how tobuild an efficient BERT-based ranking model for industry use cases.|
|[Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05908)|EMNLP 2020|1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as one of the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated distributions. 2. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of complicated data, including handwritten digits, faces, house numbers, CIFAR images, physical models of scenes, segmentation, and predicting the future from static images. 3. Introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior.|
