|[Experience Grounds Language](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.703/)|EMNLP 2020|1. Posit that the present success of representation learning approaches trained on large, text-only corpora requires the parallel tradition of research on the broader physical and social context of language to address the deeper questions of communication.|
|[DynaBERT - Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04037)|NeurIPS 2020|1. Propose a novel dynamic BERT model (DynaBERT), which can flexibly adjust the size and latency by selecting adaptive width and depth.|
|[Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05908)|EMNLP 2020|1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as one of the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated distributions. 2. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of complicated data, including handwritten digits, faces, house numbers, CIFAR images, physical models of scenes, segmentation, and predicting the future from static images. 3. Introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior.|
